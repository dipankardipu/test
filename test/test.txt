I have checked HRA Calculation in tax return which is not correct, I paid house rent about Rs 100,000, But exemption only 72,720, Please reffer Annexure to Form No. 16.
For that case I need to calim my HRA in ITR return form.

Annexure to Form No. 16
----------------------------------------
My total HRA 145,428 (12,119 per month)
HRA Exemption Calculation which is :72,720
Left is 145,428 - 72,720 = 72,708
